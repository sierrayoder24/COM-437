## Final Application Project - AHOY!
The application i've built in this course is called AHOY! Over the course of the class we had a task to build an application from what we learned over the course. I choose to build an application to help boaters find thier friends easily on the lake/ocean. 

## AHOY Descrption 
The mobile app is a social media platform/wiki page and data map for boaters in lakes/oceans! This app will contain maps and data about local restaurants, gas stations, launching points, and depth levels. Users will be notified when friends are on the lake or have just launched their boat. The wiki page will include a local page for for users to update each other on local and current events that may take place. The application I am building is a helpful resource for beginners or advanced boaters that want to be in the know at their local body of water. 

## How to use the application
I've used Android Studio to develop this application. Downloading the files and running them in Android Studio will sucessfully run the application.
